      <h2>How is this different?</h2>
      <p>This is a basic framework that contains a few elements to get you started with your web project. There are many great frameworks out there, but I thought I would make my own.</p>
      <p>This is a mobile first framework, but also a mobile experience framework.</p>

      <h2>What does 'mobile experience' mean?</h2>
      <p>If you use the internet on your mobile, you can often get a much better user experience than the desktop version of the same website. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The main content is prioritised to the top of the page. Additional content sections often wrap to the bottom of the page</li>
        <li>The content is not surrounded by distracting adverts and flash animations</li>
        <li>The site feels less cluttered and cleaner</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So I thought it would be a great idea to make a website that is the same great experience on mobile, but keep the same great experience for tablets and desktops as well.</p>

      <h2>The GREECE Principles</h2>
      <p>To summarise this philosophy, I have come up with the <strong>GREECE</strong> principles...</p>
      <h3 class="large-first">Gridless freedom</h3>
      <p>Notice that there is no grid. The content doesn't jump about the page depending what size the screen is and wrap and behave differently on different devices. You get a consistent layout on all devices.</p>
      <h3 class="large-first">Reduced CSS</h3>
      <p>Rather than spending ages overwriting default browser behaviour, make use of it. Accept that your site won't look exactly the same in every browser. Style what matters most to you, but leave the rest to default browser behaviour. Write clean CSS that doesn't overwrite other rules. Use standard HTML tags as they are meant to be used.</p>
      <h3 class="large-first">Easy to read</h3>
      <p>If you have a larger screen then make the text as easy to read as on the mobile version, but make use of the larger screens space for images and video content.</p>
      <h3 class="large-first">Easy to use</h3>
      <p>Make your site easy to use, with clear navigation and calls to action. Make buttons and links as easy to click with a mouse on a desktop device as it is to tap a button on a mobile. Make it obvious what will happen when you click on a button with thoughtful link text (don't use 'Click Here')</p>
      <h3 class="large-first">Content first</h3>
      <p>Rather than trying to fill every spare inch of space on the page, declutter the page and only show what you really need to show. Whitespace is nice for a user and helps them concentrate on what really matters.</p>
      <h3 class="large-first">Easy to code</h3>
      <p>As well as focusing on making it easy to read and use, make it easy to code.</p>
